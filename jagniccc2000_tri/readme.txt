* JagNICCC2000 (Tripple Buffering)
remix of the famous (?!) ST Demo by Leonard^Oxygene

This version uses triple buffering and has been a bit more optimized, to
challenge the 3DO version :-)

- LSP by Ericede45
- MOD by Front6

* Building

- Compiles with lyxass and rmac/rln and new_bjl
- scene2jaguar translates the original scene data into a slightly optimized
  version for the Jaguar
